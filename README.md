# Lesson1And2

Part I

1. Study the Yourdon [2] concept of a design walkthrough and the IBM concept [1] of a design inspection. Discuss the similarities and the differences between them.

2. A software engineering group is developing a mission-critical software system that will launch laser-guided missiles to its destinations. This is a new kind of product that was never built by the company. As a quality assurance manager, which code review methodology—walkthrough or inspection—would you recommend? Justify your answer.

3. What size of a review team would you recommend for the project in exercise 2, and why? What are the different roles of each member of the review team? What groups should send representatives to participate in code review?

4. Suppose that the C programming language is chosen in the project in exercise 2. Recommend a detailed code review checklist to the review team.

5. In addition to code review, what other static unit testing techniques would you recommend for the project in exercise 3? Justify your answer.

6. Describe the special role of a recordkeeper.

7. Discuss the importance of code review rework and validation.

Part II (Note: Refer to your previous software developed)
1. Attempt to draw a control flow graph for a module that you have recently developed. Determine the cyclomatic complexity for the module. Is the module too complex?

2. For your previous software project, conduct a formal code review as described in Section 3.2. Since this is by pair, choose only one software project for the code review.
